## Tech Stack
- **NextJS**
  I chose Next.js because it provides excellent SEO capabilities, which is crucial for making the app easily discoverable by users. This will help achieve the goal of encouraging more people to start journaling.

- **ReactJS**
  React.js enables me to create a single-page application (SPA), providing a seamless experience for users, especially considering the increasing use of mobile devices. Additionally, React allows for reusable components, making the design and development process more efficient and flexible.

- **ExpressJS**
  I chose Express.js to handle the backend of the application, providing a lightweight and flexible framework for building RESTful APIs and managing server-side logic. Its simplicity and scalability make it an ideal choice for building efficient, robust, and maintainable web applications.

- **MongoDB**
  I chose MongoDB as the database for MyJournal due to its flexibility, scalability, and seamless integration with modern web applications. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB's NoSQL document-based structure eliminates the need to define and maintain a strict SQL schema, making development faster and more adaptable.
